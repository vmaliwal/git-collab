####Details

  - Intro - Kaylyn and Alex
    - Discuss Hackathon Mentorship
  - Why discuss git today? 
    - Covering because at most hackathons see students who either have only used git individually or who don't understand the power of git.
    - Git as your the savior of your project - Victory and yelling at the computer 

1. What is Git
  - Talk about Linus Creating git, what drove him to go this how long this initial process took
    - Who has used VCS other than git
    - Who has heard of Linus Torvold?
    - (Confirm in the article from Jim) He created the initial framework in a weekend and after a few hours it was self hosting or being used for the projectâ€™s version control
1. Animation Project Demo
  - Fire up the summit VM
  
    ```
    username: summiteer
    password: capitalone
   ```
    - cd /media/sf_shared
  - Login demo
    - cd /animationExamples/loginExample
    - git checkout static
      - Show in xcode - view with background issues and no animations
    - git checkout dynamic
      - Show in xcode - view with animations added, background issue remains
    - git checkout background
      -  Show in xcode - animations added and background issue resolved
  - Flight Demo
1. Git Key Concepts
  - Staging Area / Working Copy
  - Git Repository
    - What is included in .git

  - Merging
1. Git in Action

1. Advance Commands / tips and tricks
  - *Unsure what to do?*
    - Copy the directory you are working on and you will be able to roll back if you have any issues
  - Rebase 
    - Discuss how this is different than a merge 
  - Squash
  - Amend
  - SSH keys
  - Aliases
1. My personal collaboration workflow for a hackathon
 - Show the summit app as an example
 - Everyone's commit history is initally messy, some clean it up with rebase or squash
